# Detection-par-boosting

This is a project of course "Big Data Processing / Traitement des Données Massives" at École Polytechnique.

It is realized in C++ by Wang SUN and Nicolas Zhao.

Main steps:

 • Train for a weak classifier using the perceptron algorithm.

 • Realize a strong classifier using the Adaboost algorithm.

 • Improve the performance with MPI (Message Passing Interface).

Files:

 • app/ contains some examples for training.

 • dev/ contains some examples for validation.

 • test/ contains some examples for test.

 • jpeg-txt/ contains the source codes for the transformation of image.

      • others: source codes.
